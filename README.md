# SemtexJS

Semtex is a JavaScript-based HTML template rendering engine.

**Writing vanilla html is verbose, tedious, and error prone.**

Semtex offers an abridged and terse syntax that makes dealing with  structured documents pleasurable.

In the browser, over-the-wire, or on the command-line tool, Semtex has been designed with flexibility and simplicity in mind.
